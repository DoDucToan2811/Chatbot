We looked in depth at what measures need to be taken as a result of both the considerable drop in global automotive production and the fall in the proportion of diesel passenger cars. This included deliberations about the powertrain technology of the future \u2013 an area in which Bosch is pursuing a broad-based approach. Here, we considered further modifications to the com-bustion engine as well the prospects for battery-electrical power-trains and fuel cells. In addition, we examined the opportunities arising for Bosch as a result of artificial intelligence, the future of factory automation, and market opportunities in energy and building technology. The board of management has the super- visory board\u2019s full support in its aim to make energy supplies at all Bosch locations worldwide carbon neutral as early as 2020. In addition, we looked in detail at business developments, the financial and capital expenditure plans, the modifications to our risk management system, and the company\u2019s internal control systems. The supervisory board kept itself informed of the internal investigations prompted by the software manipulation of diesel engine control units, as well as of the settlements reached with the authorities. We also concerned ourselves with the board of management\u2019s proposal to switch to a new auditor with effect from the 2020 business year. In addition, outside of board meetings, the chairman of the supervisory board was regularly informed by the chairman of the board of management about current developments and significant events in the company.

In this endeavor, our consultations are open, conscientious, and constructive. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschafts-pr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft audited and issued an unqualified audit opinion on the Robert Bosch GmbH annual financial statements, the Bosch Group consolidated financial statements, and the accompanying management reports as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. They furnished all these reports with an unqualified audit opinion. The supervisory board discussed these documents at length and subjected them to its own examination; all members of the super-visory board had access to the auditor\u2019s reports. Moreover, the auditor met with the supervisory board to report on the main findings of the audit, which were then discussed in detail.

Objectives and strategies have been defined in order to exploit these \nopportunities. At the same time, these changes present far-reaching  \nchallenges. This is especially true right now for the automotive sector.  \nIn 2019, the company also felt the effect of the cooling global economy and \nthe marked fall in global automotive production. Nonetheless, the success of \nmany products kept the Bosch Group\u2019s sales virtually on a par with the previ-\nous year. The development of earnings proved less favorable. This was chiefly \ndue to three factors. First, upfront investments in technologies with future \npotential such as electromobility, automated driving, artificial intelligence, \nand the internet of things (IoT) continued to grow. Second, there was the \nweakness of automotive markets such as China and India, which had pre-\nviously generated high margins, and of the diesel passenger car market \nsegment. Finally, this meant significant expenses for necessary restruc-\nturing measures, especially in the Mobility Solutions business sector.  \nAn important strategic step toward a more focused portfolio was taken \nwith the divestment of the former Packaging Technology division. The \nproceeds from the sale had a positive effect on earnings in 2019. The 2020 \nbusiness year is expected to bring a further cooldown in key markets and, \nin particular, a continued fall in global automotive production. In addition, \nthere are the possible effects of the coronavirus outbreak, whose global \nimpact cannot yet be foreseen. In our plans so far for 2020, we are assuming \nBosch Group sales will be slightly below their previous-year level. Moreover, \nwe have introduced comprehensive measures to help us return to the \nmargins of previous years in the medium term. However, we also expect \nthe 2020 result to be considerably burdened by upfront investments and \nadjustment measures.

Most of the Bosch Group\u2019s interest-bearing \nsecurities are measured in this category.\n\nBosch annual report 2019Consolidated financial statements\f74\n\nFinancial assets that do not satisfy the cash flow criterion because there are not solely payments of principal and interest on \nthe principal amount outstanding are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Changes in fair value and income \nfrom these assets are recognized immediately in profit or loss. This category mainly comprises interests in partnerships, \nshares in investment funds, certain interest-bearing securities, and derivatives with a positive market value which are mainly \nused to limit currency, interest, and commodity risks in accordance with internal risk management.\n\nThe group may, at initial recognition, irrevocably designate equity instruments that are not held for trading as measured at \nfair value through other comprehensive income (no recycling, FVOCI nR) rather than as measured at fair value through profit \nor loss. In that case, all changes in value are recognized in other comprehensive income. Cumulative changes in value are not \nreclassified to profit or loss even when the financial asset is sold. Dividend income, however, is recognized in profit or loss. \nThe Bosch Group has decided to apply this option for investments in corporations and for shares reported under securities \nbecause this measurement method appropriately presents the net assets and results of operations.\n\nWith regard to financial assets (not including equity instruments) that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, \nIFRS\u00a09 requires loss allowances to be recognized for any expected credit losses. The extent to which expected losses are \nrecognized is determined based on three levels that differ in terms of whether the credit risk on financial assets has signifi-\ncantly increased since initial recognition. Level\u00a01 includes all financial assets whose credit risk has not increased significantly \nand whose outstanding payments are up to 30 days past due.

Prescri-\nbed risk limits for the various investment categories limit the potential loss. The forecast quality of the value-at-risk \nmethod is tested by means of monthly backtesting. Management is informed monthly about risk analyses and the \nresults of investments and hedges.\n\nBosch annual report 2019Consolidated financial statements\u00a0 \n\f124\n\nCurrency risks\nCurrency risks of business operations are mitigated by the central management of selling and purchasing currencies. \nThe currency risk is determined on the basis of the worldwide consolidated cash flow in the respective currencies. \nBased on the business plan, estimated inflows and outflows in the various currencies for the planning period are \naggregated in a foreign exchange  balance plan. The resulting net position is used for the central management of \ncurrency exposures.\n\nThe largest net currency positions of the planned cash flow are in CNY, GBP, and HUF.\n\nHedging largely takes the form of forward exchange contracts; currency options and currency swaps to secure group \nfinancing  are  used  to  a  lesser  extent.  These  transactions,  which  are  only  entered  into  with  banks,  are  subject  to \nminimum requirements with respect to nature, scope, and complexity.\n\nThe risk attaching to material operating foreign currency items is determined using the value-at-risk concept, sup-\nplemented by worst-case analyses.

With certain exceptions, this requires \nrecognizing assets for the right of use and liabilities for the payment obligations under the lease in the statement \nof financial position. These accounting requirements are not applied to short-term leases and leases for low-value \nassets; lease payments under such leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nThe requirements of IFRS\u00a016 are also not applied to leases of intangible assets.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments include \nfixed payments for lease components and non-lease components as well as variable lease payments that depend \non an index or an interest rate.
