The central concern \nwill\u00a0be the quality of the learning experience. The founda-\ntion analyzes and adapts the award-winning models for \nclassroom practice, and then makes them available through \nchannels such as in-service training, publications, and \nthe\u00a0online \u201cGerman school portal.\u201d This cycle reinforces \nand disseminates good classroom practice. \n\nShaping the future of education\nIn its education work, Robert Bosch Stiftung advocates \na\u00a0future-oriented education system that is equitable,\u00a0effec-\ntive, and geared to the well-being of children and adoles-\ncents. It also looks at how current developments such as \ndigitalization will affect people, institutional learning, \nfuture coexistence, and tomorrow\u2019s world of work. \n\nMeeting global challenges\nWhen supporting work on global issues, the foundation \nhas\u00a0brought its contributions to solving global challenges \nunder\u00a0six headings: democracy, immigration society, \npeace,\u00a0climate change, migration, and inequality. It devotes \nspecial\u00a0attention to the way these issues interact.

Busi-\nness policy aims to limit these risks by means of hedging. All \nhedging transactions are managed at corporate level. Inter-\nnal regulations and guidelines set down a mandatory frame-\nwork  and  define  the  responsibilities  related  to  investment \nand  hedging  transactions.  According  to  these  regulations, \nderivatives  may  only  be  used  in  connection  with  operative \nbusiness,  financial  investments,  or  financing  transactions; \nspeculative transactions are not allowed. Trading limits are \nan  important  component  of  the  guidelines.  As  a  matter  of \nprinciple,  hedges  are  entered  into  via  banks  whose  credit-\nworthiness  is  regarded  as  impeccable;  we  take  the  rating \ngiven  by  leading  agencies  as  well  as  current  risk  assess-\nments of the financial markets into account. The creditworthi-\nness of the banking partners of the Bosch Group is closely \nmonitored and the risk mitigated by counterparty limits. \n\nTo reduce the credit risk of the bank, fixed term deposits are \nin some cases entered into as secured deposits in tri-party \nrepo transactions. In these transactions, the bank provides \npredefined securities as collateral.

of financial position when the Bosch Group be-\ncomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial in-\nstrument.
