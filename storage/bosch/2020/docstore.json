Both these endeavors were a resounding success. On the subject of workforce health, we were quick to take sweeping measures worldwide, set up our own mask production in just a few weeks, and launched a PCR rapid test for coronavirus through our medical tech-nology subsidiary. In spite of temporary production shut-downs, especially in our biggest business sector Mobility Solutions, the Bosch Group can disclose a commendable profit for 2020. Once more, Bosch\u2019s broad diversification proved to be an advantage in this crisis. With many people currently switching their focus to their domestic environment, our consumer goods \u2013 household appliances and power tools \u2013 were in great demand last year. We also benefited from our global footprint, as the pandemic-related restric-tions on public life affected the various major regions at different times.I owe a huge debt of thanks to our associates for their untiring work, as well as for their willingness to shoulder considerable burdens, including financial ones.

In our supervisory board capacity, we fulfilled our legal and regulatory obligations with great care in 2020. To protect everyone involved, we carried out meetings virtually in part, in accordance with our company statutes. We monitored the work of the board of management, and offered our advice relating to running the company, to developing Bosch Group strategy, and to individual matters affecting the company. We kept a close eye on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the company. Other subjects meriting closer attention were the future strategy of the Mobility Solutions business sector \u2013 especially in powertrain technology \u2013 and the com-prehensive performance program for enhancing the Bosch Group\u2019s competitiveness. We also concerned ourselves with HR strategy in relation to the required expansion of software expertise and to how digitalization is altering HR work. In addition, we reviewed financial and investment planning, as well as reports relating to compliance and risk management. This included reports about discussions with the authorities regarding the alleged manipulation of software in diesel engine control units. In addition, outside of board meetings, the chairman of the supervisory board was regularly informed by the chairman of the board of management about current developments and significant events in the company. For both the board of management and us, the highest priority is to safeguard the Bosch Group\u2019s successful and sustainable development over the long term in view of current challenges and the fundamental changes in our markets. In this endeavor, our consultations are open, conscientious, and constructive.

They furnished all these reports with an unqualified audit opinion. The supervisory board discussed these documents at length and subjected them to its own examination; all members of the supervisory board had access to the auditor\u2019s reports. Moreover, the auditor met with the supervisory board to report on the main findings of the audit, which were then discussed in detail.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates may result in actual outcomes that \n\nrequire a restatement to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities concerned in future periods. Assumptions \n\nand estimates concern the following:\n\nThe determination of loss allowances on receivables and contract assets is based on estimates and assump-\n\ntions with respect to the credit standing of individual customers. The measurement of inventories requires \n\nassumptions and estimates to be made, including for determining the net realizable value. The discounted \n\nfuture cash flows used as a basis for testing goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant, and equip-\n\nment for impairment are based on estimates. Assumptions are also made in the determination of the discount \n\nrates and growth rates used. Determining lease terms requires assumptions and estimates with respect to \n\nthe likelihood of options to terminate or extend the lease being exercised. The recognition of deferred tax \n\nassets is premised on their future recoverability being probable. Consequently, assumptions have to be made \n\nregarding future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences. Further \n\nassumptions are required to determine the useful lives of items subject to wear and tear within property, \n\nplant,  and  equipment,  and  intangible  assets.  The  determination  of  carrying  amounts  of  investments  also \n\ninvolves making assumptions and estimates. Pension provisions and similar obligations are measured using \n\nactuarial methods. This requires various assumptions, including with respect to life expectancy, salary trends, \n\nthe pension growth rate, and the discount factor.

For customer-specific products that are allocable to the Mobility Solutions business sector and do \n\nnot create an asset with an alternative use for the group, revenue is recognized over time; the same applies \n\nto  plant  engineering  contracts  in  the  Industrial  Technology  business  sector  and  the  Energy  and  Building \n\nTechnology business sector. Revenue is recognized according to the percentage of completion, which can \n\nbe determined using input or output methods. Output methods recognize revenue on the basis of the value \n\nto the customer of the goods or services transferred relative to the remaining goods or services promised \n\nunder the contract. Input methods recognize revenue on the basis of costs incurred relative to the estimated \n\ntotal costs. Depending on the underlying business model, the Bosch Group uses input methods as well as \n\noutput methods in determining the percentage of completion.\n\nSales revenue comprises an amount of EUR 1,195 million (previous year: EUR 1,275 million) that had been \n\nincluded in the balance of current contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\nIn relation to performance obligations not satisfied in full or in part as of the reporting date, an amount of \n\nEUR 4 million (previous year: EUR 35 million) is expected to be realized as sales revenue within the next two \n\nyears and an amount of EUR 10 million (previous year: EUR 10 million) thereafter.
