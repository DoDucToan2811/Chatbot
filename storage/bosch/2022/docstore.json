Nonetheless, \nthe business sectors\u2019 markets and competitive environments \nvary, in some cases considerably.\n\nIn the case of Mobility Solutions, the Bosch Group has long \ncompeted mainly with a small number of major automotive \nsuppliers. Its chief customers have been globally operating \nautomakers  and  major  regional  producers.  However,  this \nmarket is changing due to increasing electri\ufb01cation, automa-\ntion, connectivity, and multimodal mobility, as well as to a \nrise in the signi\ufb01cance and value of software in vehicles. The \nintegration of electronics and software into vehicles, as well \nas growing complexity, are having an impact on vehicle archi-\ntectures. In this context, customers in the automotive indus-\ntry  often  no  longer  buy  hardware  and  software  as  a  single \npackage, but independently of each other. At the same time, \nthey  expect  software  to  combine  and  integrate  functions \nthat were previously separate. At present, vehicle architec-\ntures focus on what can be offered in the car. In the future, \nhowever, there will also be a stronger focus on hardware and \nsoftware  outside  the  vehicle,  with  the  cloud  also  playing  a \ncentral  role.  This  will  enable  software  updates  throughout \nthe vehicle life cycle and scaling of applications in other mar-\nkets. The result is shorter time-to-market, end-to-end archi-\ntectures,  and  hardware-agnostic  software  and  services.  It \n\nalso means that new business models will arise. The com-\nplexity involved in operating systems for vehicles means that \nmany  automakers  seek  support  from  software  providers  in \nthe automotive segment.\n\nThese trends make the market attractive for additional sup-\npliers, including suppliers from industries such as consumer \nelectronics, semiconductors, and the services and internet \nsector, as well as for the providers of mobility platforms.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 57657, "end_char_idx": 59856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "728be7b5-623d-43f2-aeaa-6609825b53f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "728be7b5-623d-43f2-aeaa-6609825b53f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4b617cc-b7d6-49fa-b339-2d69edca5452", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a8917c715e5acc702e4299a159669ce5c5cc5642d22747e32349f71740f2507", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "388036be-f0db-4c73-b471-27fbb0c61149", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0074587e62c1c310672959cc9bf9709a224ec8da1741ae9694a9928c536a615", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91c547aa-c4bb-4e25-a803-371f4c63492f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69f5e32cdd0efd1eee2daabdc94635f62089ec190bfe266109e91c853720aa2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the future, \nhowever, there will also be a stronger focus on hardware and \nsoftware  outside  the  vehicle,  with  the  cloud  also  playing  a \ncentral  role.

Essentially, digitaliza-\ntion  is  about  \ufb01ve  key  areas:  fascinating  our  users  and  cus-\ntomers with customer-centric solutions, unlocking business \npotential through software and services, creating additional \nvalue by setting up digital ecosystems with partners, making \nBosch  faster  and  more  ef\ufb01cient,  and  developing  our  asso-\nciates  and  empowering  digital  talent.  One  core  element \nfor\u00a0 implementing  our  strategy  is  harnessing  the  power  of \narti\ufb01cial  intelligence  with  respect  to  connected,  internal \nprocesses such as development, production, logistics, and \nadministration,  as  well  as  for  the  expansion  of  third-party \nbusiness with digital solutions. To this end, we still need to \nbroaden knowledge within the company of the opportunities \nand requirements of digital business.\n\nTo make our progress transparent, we are working to de\ufb01ne \nnew business-speci\ufb01c metrics. These metrics may be things \nsuch as software sales, sales from e-commerce and digital \nservices,  or  cost  savings  due  to  digital  solutions.  The  new \nmetrics build on the indicators we have used in recent years \nfor  tracking  purposes.  For  example,  we  have  tracked  the \ngrowth of expertise in making our electronic product classes \nweb-enabled.\n\nIn addition, we are working on the organizational setup of our \ndigitalization activities.

The Covid-19 pandemic pre-\nsented  us  with  major  challenges  in  this  respect.  Over  the \ncourse of 2022, the rate of coronavirus infections subsided in \nmany regions, and when infections did occur, they were less \nsevere. This meant we could relax or lift hygiene measures \nand rules of conduct at Bosch as well. In light of these devel-\nopments, the task force we formed in 2020 was dissolved in \nmid-2022. The wide-ranging reporting tools, which provided \nup-to-date information on how the pandemic was developing \nin the various countries, on cases of the virus at Bosch, on \ncapacity utilization at the plants, and on safeguarding sup-\nplies to customers, have been discontinued for now, but can \nbe reactivated if necessary. That said, China was affected by \nsharply rising infection rates in the second half of 2022. This \nimpacted  our  associates  as  well,  some  of  whom  worked \nfrom home for long periods of time or lived in our factories \nand were provided for there. By the end of 2022, most had \nrecovered from the infection and returned to their jobs.\n\nSemiconductor shortages continue to be a major challenge, \nparticularly in the Mobility Solutions business sector, even \nthough the situation in 2022 was better than in 2021.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 103019, "end_char_idx": 105055, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59865073-64fc-4f3c-a827-283ffea4d006": {"__data__": {"id_": "59865073-64fc-4f3c-a827-283ffea4d006", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4b617cc-b7d6-49fa-b339-2d69edca5452", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a8917c715e5acc702e4299a159669ce5c5cc5642d22747e32349f71740f2507", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79d523d3-ea5e-4be0-9e70-e143fb3819f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "499527b43e6b04cfa942aaa4e4631b61777a1939db0bca4b9f2e17a703e0b77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12456e99-cfca-4dc6-b7d7-46aca990f779", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a721324ea8c5fd5ba13761892810e2a260740f54d72aa14d02feeaef395d4f48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The wide-ranging reporting tools, which provided \nup-to-date information on how the pandemic was developing \nin the various countries, on cases of the virus at Bosch, on \ncapacity utilization at the plants, and on safeguarding sup-\nplies to customers, have been discontinued for now, but can \nbe reactivated if necessary.

Capital and risk management\n\nCapital management\nThe  Bosch  Group\u2019s  goal  is  to  achieve  sustainable  growth \nthrough  innovation  while  maintaining  its  \ufb01nancial  indepen-\ndence. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to maintain a high \ninternal  \ufb01nancing  ability,  along  with  unrestricted  access  to \ncapital markets, which is ensured by a solid A rating at a min-\nimum. Capital structure and other \ufb01nancial performance in-\ndicators, such as free cash \ufb02ow, are tracked as part of \ufb01nan-\ncial planning. As of December\u00a031, 2022, the Bosch Group\u2019s \nequity ratio as a percentage of total assets was 47\u00a0percent \n(previous  year:  45\u00a0 percent).  Depending  on  market  circum-\nstances,  the  volume  required,  and  the  preferred  currency, \nthe  Bosch  Group  generally  raises  debt  capital  on  capital \nmarkets in the form of bonds, promissory loans, registered \nnotes, and commercial paper programs.
